        <h2>Meditation</h2>
        <section class="article1">

            <article>Over the last few decades more and more scientists have started researching its amazing benefits.
                Mindfulness and meditation practices help us cultivate awareness of ourselves and the external
                environment.
                Some of the many benefits are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Improves your focus and attention</li>
                    <li>Increases your ability to handle and response to stress</li>

        <h2>Get Outside</h2>
        <section class="article2">

            <article>Being outside in nature has amazing health benefits. Studies have shown that walking in nature
                improves
                your
                memory, concentration and makes you happier. Another amazing benefit of being outside is to get more
                vitamin
                D. In Australia, where I live, many people aren't getting enough vitamin D so being outside is
                especially
                important in making sure you get enough vitamin D.</article>

        <section class="article3">

            <article>We all know exercise is good for you, but some people don't exercise enough. One of the best ways
                you
                can
                make sure you exercise is to enjoy it. Many people think exercise means going to the gym 2 hours a day
                every
                day, but that is just one way you can exercise. Making sure you enjoy the exercise is just as important
                as
                doing it. Here are some more creative ways you can exercise:
